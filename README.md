# pokegofinder
A python tool for spitting out certain specific Pokemon Go search strings.

Ever wanted to just find paledian woopers AND hisuian growlithes AND costumed pichus? Me too! This takes the input of your wanted poke species and then reverses it so you can get just what you want.

Well, it just basically performs a mask of the pokemon so they are all &! but it doesn't quite do what I tought it was going to do, but feel free to try it out.
